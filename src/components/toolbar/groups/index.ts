/**
 * @fileoverview Toolbar Groups Index
 * 
 * This module exports all toolbar feature groups.
 * Each group is a functional component that renders a set of related toolbar buttons.
 * 
 * Groups are designed to be used within the ErixToolbar component and can be
 * selectively included based on feature requirements.
 */

// Future exports for modular toolbar groups:
// export * from './history-group';
// export * from './heading-group';
// export * from './font-group';
// export * from './alignment-group';
// export * from './format-group';
// export * from './list-group';
// export * from './utility-group';

// Note: Currently, all toolbar logic is contained within erix-toolbar.tsx
// These group components can be extracted for more granular control when needed.
